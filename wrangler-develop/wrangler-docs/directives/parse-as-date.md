# Parse as Date

The PARSE-AS-DATE directive is for parsing dates using natural language processing.


## Syntax
```
parse-as-date <column> [<time-zone>]
```

## Usage Notes

The PARSE-AS-DATE directive will apply standard language recognition and translation techniques to produce a list of
corresponding dates with optional parse and syntax information.

It recognizes dates described in many ways, including formal dates (`02/28/1979`), relaxed dates (`oct 1st`),
relative dates (`the day before next thursday`), and even date alternatives (`next wed or thurs`).

This directive will also search for date components within a larger block of text, detect their structure, and
create dates.

It will create a new column using the syntax `<column>_1` containing the results of parsing.

If `<time-zone>` is not provided, UTC is used as the timezone.


## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "create_date": "now",
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
parse-as-date create_date US/Eastern
```

would result in this record (the actual results depending on when this was run):
```
{
  "create_date": "now",
  "create_date_1": "Mon May 01 14:13:35 EDT 2017"
}
```
