# Parse as JSON

The PARSE-AS-JSON directive is for parsing a JSON object. The directive can operate on
String or JSONObject types. When the directive is applied, the high-level keys of the JSON
are appended to the original column name to create new column names.


## Syntax
```
parse-as-json <column-name> [<depth>]
```

* `<column-name>` is the name of the column in the record that is a JSON object
* `<depth>` indicates the depth at which JSON object enumeration terminates

## Usage Notes

The PARSE-AS-JSON directive breaks down complex JSON into simpler
understandable and manageable chunks. When first applied on a JSON object, it breaks it
down into keys and values. The value could in itself be a JSON object on which you can
apply the PARSE-AS-JSON directive again to flatten it out further.

The key names in the event object are appeneded to the column that is being applied JSON
parsing. The column names use dot notation.

## Examples

Using this record as an example, in a field `body`:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": {
    "first": "Root",
    "last": "Joltie"
  },
  "age": 22,
  "weigth": 184,
  "height": 5.8
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
parse-as-json body
```

would result in this record:

| Field Name    | Field Values                            | Field Type |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `body`        | `{ ... }`                               | String     |
| `body_id`     | 1                                       | Integer    |
| `body_name`   | `{ "first": "Root", "last": "Joltie" }` | JSONObject |
| `body_age`    | 22                                      | Integer    |
| `body_weight` | 184                                     | Integer    |
| `body_height` | 5.8                                     | Double     |

Applying the same directive, but just on the field `body_name` would result in this record:

| Field Name        | Field Values                            | Field Type |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `body`            | `{ ... }`                               | String     |
| `body_id`         | 1                                       | Integer    |
| `body_name`       | `{ "first": "Root", "last": "Joltie" }` | JSONObject |
| `body_name_first` | Root                                    | String     |
| `body_name_last`  | Joltie                                  | String     |
| `body_age`        | 22                                      | Integer    |
| `body_weight`     | 184                                     | Integer    |
| `body_height`     | 5.8                                     | Double     |
