# Table Lookup

The TABLE-LOOKUP directive performs lookups into Table datasets.


## Syntax
```
table-lookup <column> <table>
```

* `<column>` is an existing column that exists in both the current records and the table
* `<table>` is a Table Dataset that has a column named by `<column>`


## Usage Notes

The TABLE-LOOKUP directive uses a column as the lookup key into a specified Table
dataset for each record. The column should be of type string. The values in the row of the
Table will be parsed as strings and placed in the record in new columns, the names
constructed from combining the lookup key and the row column name with an underscore.


## Example

This example represents a lookup into the `customerTable` dataset of type Table, where the
record's field name `customerUserId` will be used as the lookup key.

Suppose that this data is in the Table `customerTable`:

| CustomerUserId   | City              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| bobistheman      | Palo Alto, CA     |
| joe1984          | Los Angeles, CA   |
| randomUserqwerty | New York City, NY |

If the input records to the directive are:

| CustomerUserId | Product | Quantity |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| bobistheman    | Apples  | 10       |
| joe1984        | Bicycle | 1        |

Applying this directive:
```
table-lookup customerUserId customerTable
```

would result in these output records:

| CustomerUserId | Product | Quantity | CustomerUserId_City |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| bobistheman    | Apples  | 10       | Palo Alto, CA       |
| joe1984        | Bicycle | 1        | Los Angeles, CA     |
