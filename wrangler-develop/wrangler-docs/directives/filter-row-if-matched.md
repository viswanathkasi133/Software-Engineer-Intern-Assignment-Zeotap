# Filter Row If Matched

The FILTER-ROW-IF-MATCHED directive filters records that match a pattern for a column.


## Syntax
```
filter-row-if-matched <column> <regex>
```

The `<regex>` is a valid regular expression that is evaluated on the column value for every record.


## Usage Notes

The FILTER-ROW-IF-MATCHED directive applies the regular expression on a column value for
every record. If the regex matches the column value, the record is omitted, otherwise it
is passed as-is to the input of the next directive.

If the regex is `null`, the value is compared against all the `null` as well as JSON null values.


## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Joltie, Root",
  "emailid": "jolti@hotmail.com",
  "hrlywage": "12.34",
  "gender": "Male",
  "country": "US"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
filter-row-if-matched country !~ US
```
would result in filtering out records for individuals that are not in the US (where
`country` does not match "US").

Applying this directive:
```
filter-row-if-matched (country !~ US && hrlywage > 12)
```
would result in filtering out records for individuals that are not in the US (where
`country` does not match "US") and whose hourly wage (`hrlywage`) is greater than 12.
