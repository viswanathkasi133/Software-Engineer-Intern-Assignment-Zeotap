# Find and Replace

The FIND-AND-REPLACE directive transforms string column values using a "sed"-like
expression to find and replace text.


## Syntax
```
find-and-replace <column> <sed-script>
```


## Usage Notes

This directive is a column-oriented text processor that operates on a single value in the given column.
The `sed-script` is applied on each text value to transform the data.

A typical example on how the directive is used:
```
find-and-replace <column> s/regex/replacement/g
```

This directive will replace a value of the column that matches the `regex`
with the `replacement` value.

The `s` stands for "substitute". The `g` stands for "global", which means that all matching
occurrences in the value would be replaced.

The regular expression to be matched is placed after the first delimiting symbol (a
forward-slash in this example) and the replacement value follows the second delimiting
symbol. A forward-slash (`/`) is the conventional symbol used as a delimiter, and the
origin of the character for "search".

For example, to replace all occurrences of `hello` with `world` in the column `message`:
```
find-and-replace message s/hello/world/g
```

If you want to change a pathname that contains a slash (such as `/usr/local/bin` to
`/common/bin`), you can use a backslash to escape any slashes:
```
  find-and-replace column s/\/usr\/local\/bin/\/common\/bin//g
```


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "body": "one two three four five six seven eight"
}
```

Applying these two directives:
```
find-and-replace body s/one/ONE/g
find-and-replace body s/two/2/g
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": "ONE 2 three four five six seven eight",
}
```
