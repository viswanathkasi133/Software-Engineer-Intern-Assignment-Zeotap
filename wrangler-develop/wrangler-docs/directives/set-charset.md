# Set Charset

The SET-CHARSET directive sets the encoding of the current data and then converts it
from that to a UTF-8 string.


## Syntax
```
 set-charset <column> <charset>
```

* `column` is the name of the column to be converted
* `charset` is the charset to be used in converting the column


## Usage Notes

This directive sets the character set of `column` to `charset`. It decodes the column
using that `charset` and converts it to a UTF-8 String.
