# Columns Replace

The COLUMNS-REPLACE directive alters column names in bulk.


## Syntax
```
columns-replace <sed-expression>
```

The `<sed-expression>` specifies the [sed
expression](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/Regular-Expressions.html)
syntax, such as `s/data_//g`.


## Example

Using this record as an example, these columns all have `data_` as a prefix in their
column names:
```
{
  "data_name": "root",
  "data_first_name": "mars",
  "data_last_name": "joltie",
  "data_data_id": 1,
  "data_address": "150 Mars Ave, Mars City, Mars, 8899898",
  "mars_ssn": "MARS-456282"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
columns-replace s/^data_//g
```

would result in the record having any column names that were prefixed with `data_`
replaced with an empty string:
```
{
  "name": "root",
  "first_name": "mars",
  "last_name": "joltie",
  "data_id": 1,
  "address": "150 Mars Ave, Mars City, Mars, 8899898",
  "mars_ssn": "MARS-456282"
}
```

**Note:** The field value is untouched during this directive. This operates only on the
column names.
