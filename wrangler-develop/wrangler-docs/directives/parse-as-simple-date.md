# Parse as Simple Date

The PARSE-AS-SIMPLE-DATE directive parses date strings.


## Syntax
```
parse-as-simple-date <column> <pattern>
```


## Usage Notes

The PARSE-AS-SIMPLE-DATE directive will parse a date string, using a pattern string. If
the column is `null` or has already been parsed as a date, applying this directive is a
no-op. The column to be parsed as a date should be of type string.


## Examples

See [FORMAT-DATE](format-date.md) for an explanation and example of these pattern strings.
