# Diff Date

The DIFF-DATE directive calculates the difference between two dates.


## Syntax
```
diff-date <column1> <column2> <destination>
```


## Usage Notes

The DIFF-DATE directive calculates the difference between two Date objects (`<column1>`
minus `<column2>`) and puts the difference (in milliseconds) into the destination column.

This directive can only be applied on two columns whose date strings have already been
parsed, either using the [PARSE-AS-DATE](parse-as-date.md) or
[PARSE-AS-SIMPLE-DATE](parse-as-simple-date.md) directives.

A negative difference can be returned when the first column is an earlier date than the
second column.

If one of the dates in the column is `null`, the resulting column will be `null`.

If any of the columns contains the string `now`, then the current date-time will be
substituted for it. When `now` is encountered, the directive applies the same value for
`now` across all rows.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "create_date": "02/12/2017",
  "update_date": "02/14/2017"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
diff-date update_date create_date diff_date
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "create_date": "02/12/2017",
  "update_date": "02/14/2017",
  "diff_date": 17280000
}
```
