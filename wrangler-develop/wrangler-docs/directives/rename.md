# Rename

The RENAME directive renames an existing column in the record.


## Syntax
```
rename <old> <new>
```

* `<old>` is the name of an existing column to be renamed
* `<new>` is the new name of the column


## Usage Notes

The RENAME directive will rename the specified column name by replacing it with a new
name. The original column name will no longer be available in the record after this directive
has been applied to the record.

The RENAME directive will only rename a column that exists. If the column name does not
exist in the record, the operation will be ignored without an error.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "x": 6.3,
  "y": 187,
  "codes": {
    "a": "code1",
    "b": 2
  }
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
rename x height
rename y weight
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "height": 6.3,
  "weight": 187,
  "codes": {
    "a": "code1",
    "b": 2
  }
}
```
