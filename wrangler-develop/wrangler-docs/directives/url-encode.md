# URL Encode

The URL-ENCODE directive encodes a string to the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
MIME format.


## Syntax
```
url-encode <column>
```

The `<column>` contains a URL to be encoded.


## Usage Notes

See https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1 for details of these rules.

When encoding a string, these rules apply:

* The alphanumeric characters `a` through `z`, `A` through `Z`, and `0` through `9` remain
  unchanged
* The special characters `.`, `-`, `*`, and `_` remain unchanged
* The space character ` ` is converted into a plus sign (`+`)
* All other characters are considered unsafe and are first converted into one or more
  bytes using an encoding scheme. Each byte is then represented by a 3-character string
  `%xy`, where `xy` is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended
  encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not
  specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used.

**Note:** Uses UTF-8 as the encoding scheme for the string.
