# Copy

The COPY directive copies values from a source column into a destination column.


## Syntax
```
copy <source> <destination> [<force>]
```

The COPY directive copies data from the `<source>` column into the `<destination>` column.

If the `<destination>` column already exists, the `<force>` option can be set to `true` to
override any existing data in that column. By default, the `<force>` option is set to
`false`.


## Usage Notes

The COPY directive will copy data from `<source>` if and only if `<source>` column exists.
If the `<source>` doesn't exist in the record, the execution will fail with an error.

Copying makes a deep copy of the source into the destination. The type of data from the
source in the destination column is maintained as-is.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234434343,
  "measurement": 10.45,
  "isvalid": true,
  "message": {
     "code": 132,
     "text": "Failure in the temperature sensor"
  }
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
copy timestamp datetime
copy message status
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234434343,
  "datetime": 1234434343,
  "measurement": 10.45,
  "isvalid": true,
  "message": {
     "code": 132,
     "text": "Failure in the temperature sensor"
  },
  "status": {
      "code": 132,
      "text": "Failure in the temperature sensor"
  }
}
```
