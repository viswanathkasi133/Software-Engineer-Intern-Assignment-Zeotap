# Write as JSON Map

The WRITE-AS-JSON-MAP directive converts the record into a JSON map.


## Syntax
```
write-as-json-map <column>
```

The `<column>` will contain a JSON map of all the fields in the record.


## Usage Notes

The WRITE-AS-JSON-MAP directive converts the entire record into a JSON map. If the
`<column>` already exists, it will overwrite it.

Depending on the type of object a field is holding, it will be transformed appropriately.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "int": 1,
  "string": "this, is a string."
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
write-as-json-map body
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": { "int":1, "string": "this, is a string." },
  "int": 1,
  "string": "this, is a string."
}
```
