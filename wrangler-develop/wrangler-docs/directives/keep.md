# Keep

The KEEP directive is used to keep specified columns from the record. This is the
opposite behavior of the [DROP](drop.md) directive.


## Syntax
```
keep <column>[,<column>]
```

`column` is the name of a column in the record to be kept.


## Usage Notes

After the KEEP directive is applied, the column(s) specified in the directive are
preserved, and all other columns are removed from the record.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234434343,
  "measurement": 10.45,
  "isvalid": true
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
keep id,measurement
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "measurement": 10.45
}
```
