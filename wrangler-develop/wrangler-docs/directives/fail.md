# Fail on condition

The FAIL directive will fail processing of pipeline when condition is evaulated
to `true`.


## Syntax
```
fail <condition>
```

The `<condition>` is a JEXL expression specifing the condition that governs if the record
should be sent to the error collector.


## Usage Notes

The most common use of the FAIL directive is to fail further processing of the
pipeline when the condition is met.

## Example

Assume a record that has these three fields:

* Error Name
* Error Count

These directives will implement these rules; any records that match any of these
conditions will terminate further processing of the pipeline.

```
fail ErrorCount > 1
```
