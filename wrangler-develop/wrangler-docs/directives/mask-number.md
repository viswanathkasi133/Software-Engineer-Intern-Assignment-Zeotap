# Mask Number

The MASK-NUMBER directive applies substitution masking on the column values.


## Syntax
```
mask-number <columm> <pattern>
```

* The `<column>` specifies the name of an existing column to be masked
* The `<pattern>` is a substitution pattern to be used to mask the column values.


## Usage Notes

Substitution masking is generally used for masking credit card or social security numbers.
The MASK-NUMBER applies substitution masking on the column values. This type of masking
is fixed masking, where the pattern is applied on the fixed length string.

These rules are used for the pattern:

* Use of `#` will include the digit from the position
* Use `x` or any other character to mask the digit at that position


## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie",
  "ssn": "000-00-0000",
  "cc": "4929790943424701"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
mask-number ssn XXX-XX-####
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie",
  "ssn": "XXX-XX-0000",
  "cc": "4929790943424701"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
mask-number cc XXXXXXXXXXXX####
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie",
  "ssn": "000-00-0000",
  "cc": "XXXXXXXXXXXX4701"
}
```
