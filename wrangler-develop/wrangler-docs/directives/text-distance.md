# Text Distance

The TEXT-DISTANCE directive measures the difference between two sequences of characters,
using a specified method of measuring the distance between strings.


## Syntax
```
text-distance <method> <column-1> <column-2> <destination>
```

* `<method>` specifies the method to be used to measure the distance between the strings of
  `<column-1>` and `<column-2>`
* `<destination>` is the column the resulting difference will be stored in. If it exists, it
  will be overwritten. If it does not exist, it will be created.

**Note:** If either or both of the two columns do not exist, no error will be returned,
and the destination column will still be created or overwritten.


## Usage Notes

These distance measure methods are supported:

* `block-distance`
* `block`
* `cosine`
* `damerau-levenshtein`
* `dice`
* `euclidean`
* `generalized-jaccard`
* `identity`
* `jaccard`
* `jaro`
* `levenshtein`
* `longest-common-subsequence`
* `longest-common-substring`
* `overlap-cofficient`
* `simon-white`


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "tweet1": "CheeseBurgers are God tellin us everything's gonna be cool...",
  "tweet2": "Forgiveness can open up a whole new perspective on life, Forgiveness is an act of God's grace."
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
text-distance block tweet1 tweet2 distance
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "tweet1": "CheeseBurgers are God tellin us everything's gonna be cool...",
  "tweet2": "Forgiveness can open up a whole new perspective on life, Forgiveness is an act of God's grace."
  "destination": 26.0
}
```
