# Cut Character

The CUT-CHARACTER directive selects parts of a string value, accepting standard [cut
options](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1.html).


## Syntax
```
cut-character <source> <destination> <type> <range|indexes>
```

The `<type> <range|indexes>` are the standard [cut options](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1.html).


## Usage Notes

The standard options for the CUT-CHARACTER directive include a list of one or more ranges of characters.
Each range is prefaced with a type (`-b` byte, `-c` character, `-f` field) and written as:

* `N  ` The N'th byte, character, or field, counting from 1
* `N- ` From the N'th byte, character, or field, to the end of the line
* `N-M` From the N'th to M'th (included) byte, character, or field
* `-M ` From the first to M'th (included) byte, character, or field


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "body": "one two three four five six seven eight"
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
cut-character body one -c 1-3
cut-character body two -c 5-7
cut-character body three -c 9-13
cut-character body four -c 15-
cut-character body five -c 1,2,3
cut-character body six -c -3
cut-character body seven -c 1,2,3-5
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": "one two three four five six seven eight",
  "one": "one",
  "two": "two",
  "three": "three",
  "four": "four five six seven eight",
  "five": "one",
  "six": "one",
  "seven": "one t"
}
```
