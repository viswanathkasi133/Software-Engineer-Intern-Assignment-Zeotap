# Set a transient variable

The SET-VARIABLE directive increments the value of the variable that is
local to the input record being processed.

## Syntax
```
set-variable <variable> <expression>
```

The `<variable>` is set the result of `<expression>`.

## Usage Notes

This directive is applied only within the scope of the record being processed.
The transient state is reset, once the system starts processing of the new record.
