# Split to Columns

The SPLIT-TO-COLUMNS directive splits a column based on a regular expression into
multiple columns.


## Syntax

```
 split-to-columns <column> <regex>
```

The `<column>` is split into one or more columns around matches of the specified regular 
expression `<regex>`.


## Usage Notes

The SPLIT-TO-COLUMNS directive takes a column, applies the regular expression separator,
and then creates multiple columns from the split. The name of the columns are in the
format:
```
{
  "column": "...",
  "column_1": "...",
  "column_2": "...",
  "column_3": "...",
  ...
  "column_n": "..."
}
```

Regular expressions allows the use of complex search patterns when splitting the data in
the column. It supports standard
[Java regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
constructs.

The original column, when it is split into columns, generates new columns for the record.
`column_1`, `column_2`, through to `column_n` are the new columns that contain the `n`
parts of the split generated from applying this directive.

**Note:** This directive can only operate on columns of type string.


## Examples

If we have a `<separator>` pattern of `,` (a comma) over the string:

`This will be split 1,This will be split 2,This will be split 3,Split 4`

This will generate four new columns:
```
{
  "1": "This will be split 1",
  "2": "This will be split 2",
  "3": "This will be split 3",
  "4": "Split 4"
}
```

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "codes": "USD|AUD|AMD|XCD"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
split-to-columns codes \|
```

**Note:** A backslash is required to escape the pipe character (`|`) as it is an optional
separator in a regex pattern.

This would result in four columns being generated, with each split value being assigned to
the column `codes`:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "codes": "USD|AUD|AMD|XCD",
  "codes_1": "USD",
  "codes_2": "AUD",
  "codes_3": "AMD",
  "codes_4": "XCD"
}
```
