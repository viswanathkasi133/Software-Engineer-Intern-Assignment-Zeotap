# Increment a transient variable

The INCREMENT-VARIABLE directive increments the value of the variable that is
local to the input record being processed.

## Syntax
```
increment-variable <variable> <value> <expression>
```

The `<variable>` is incremented by the `<value>` when the `<expression>` evaluates to
true.

## Usage Notes

This directive is applied only within the scope of the record being processed.
The transient state is reset, once the system starts processing of the new record.

Internally, this directive increments a `long` value.
