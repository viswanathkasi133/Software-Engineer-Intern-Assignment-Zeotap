# Write as CSV

The WRITE-AS-CSV directive converts a record into CSV format.


## Syntax
```
write-as-csv <column>
```

The `<column>` will contain the CSV representation of the record.


## Usage Notes

The WRITE-AS-CSV directive converts the entire record into CSV. If the `<column>` already
exists, it will overwrite it.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "int": 1,
  "string": "this, is a string."
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
write-as-csv body
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": "1,\"this, is a string.\",
  "int": 1,
  "string": "this, is a string."
}
```
