# Filter Row If True

The FILTER-ROW-IF-TRUE directive filters records that match a condition.


## Deprecated

Use the [FILTER-ROWS-ON](filter-rows-on.md) directive instead.


## Syntax
```
filter-row-if-true <condition>
```

The `<condition>` is a valid boolean expression resulting in either a `true` or `false`.


## Usage Notes

The FILTER-ROW-IF-TRUE directive evaluates the Boolean condition for each record. If the
result of evaluation is `true`, it skips the record, otherwise it is passed as-is to the
input of the next directive.

The `<condition>` is specified in the JEXL expression language with additional utility
libraries are defined in the `math` and `string` namespaces.

For information on how to write JEXL expressions, see the [commons-jexl
documentation](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html).


## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Joltie, Root",
  "hrlywage": "12.34",
  "gender": "Male",
  "country": "US"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
filter-row-if-true country !~ US
```
would result in filtering out records for individuals that are not in the US (where
`country` does not match "US").

Applying this directive:
```
filter-row-if-true (country !~ US && hrlywage > 12)
```
would result in filtering out records for individuals that are not in the US (where
`country` does not match "US") and whose hourly wage (`hrlywage`) is greater than 12.
