# Quantize

The QUANTIZE directive quantizes a column based on specified ranges.


## Syntax
```
copy <source> <destination> <range_lower1:range_upper1=value>[,<range_lower2:range_upper2=value>*]
```

* The `<source>` column is the column to be quantized
* The `<destination>` column is the column where the results of the quantization are to be written

The QUANTIZE directive quantizes based on values of the `<source>` column.


## Usage Notes

The QUANTIZE directive quantizes based on values from the `<source>` column into the
`<destination>` column.

Using the list of ranges specified in the options, it will `<value>` into the
`<destination>` column if the source value matches one of the ranges.

The last range that the source value matches is the one that will be used.

If a range limit is missing, that range will fail without an error or exception.

If the `<destination>` column already exists, the directive will override any existing
data in that column.

The values in the `<source>` column must be numeric.

The `<value>` of the range can be numeric or a string.


## Example

Using these records as an example:
```
[
  {
    "body": 1
  },
  {
    "body": 2
  },
  {
    "body": 3
  },
  {
    "body": 4
  },
  {
    "body": 5
  },
]
```

Applying this directives:
```
quantize body body_q 1:2=20,3:4=40,5:10=max
```

would result in these records:
```
[
  {
    "body": 1,
    "body_q": 20
  },
  {
    "body": 2,
    "body_q": 20
  },
  {
    "body": 3,
    "body_q": 40
  },
  {
    "body": 4,
    "body_q": 40
  },
  {
    "body": 5,
    "body_q": "max"
  },
]
```
