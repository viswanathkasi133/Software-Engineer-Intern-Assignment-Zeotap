# Encode

The ENCODE directive encodes a column value as one of `base32`, `base64`, or `hex`
following [RFC-4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).


## Syntax
```
encode <base32|base64|hex> <column>
```

The `<column>` is the name of the column to which the encoding is applied.


## Usage Notes

Base encoding of data is used in many situations to store or transfer data in environments
that, for legacy reasons, are restricted to US-ASCII data. Base encoding can be used in
new applications that do not have legacy restrictions because it allows the manipulation
of objects with text editors.

The ENCODE directive generates a new column with a name following the format of
`<column>_encode_<type>`.

Different column values are handled following these rules:

* If the column is `null`, the resulting column will also be `null`.
* If the column specified is not found in the record, then the record is skipped as a no-op.
* If the column value is not of either type string or byte array, it fails.

See also the [DECODE](dedcode.md) directive.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "col1": "Base32 Encoding",
  "col2": "Testing Base 64 Encoding",
  "col3": "Hex Encoding"
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
encode base32 col1
encode base64 col2
encode hex col3
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "col1": "Base32 Encoding",
  "col2": "Testing Base 64 Encoding",
  "col3": "Hex Encoding",
  "col1_encode_base32": "IJQXGZJTGIQEK3TDN5SGS3TH",
  "col2_encode_base64": "VGVzdGluZyBCYXNlIDY0IEVuY29kaW5n",
  "col3_encode_hex": "48657820456e636f64696e67"
}
```
