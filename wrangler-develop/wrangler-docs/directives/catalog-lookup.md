# Catalog Lookup

The CATALOG-LOOKUP directive provides lookups into catalogs that are pre-loaded
(static). Currently, the directive supports looking up health care ICD-9 and
ICD-10-{2016,2017} codes.


## Syntax
```
catalog-lookup <catalog> <column>
```

The `<catalog>` specifies the dictionary which should be used for looking up the value in
the `<column>`.

These catalogs are currently supported:

* ICD-9
* ICD-10-2016
* ICD-10-2017


## Usage Notes

Using this record as an example: a record containing a single field (`code`) that requires
looking up:
```
{
  "code": "Y36521S"
}
```

Applying the CATALOG-LOOKUP directive with the ICD-10-2016 Catalog:
```
catalog-lookup ICD-10-2016 code
```

would result in the record having an additional column `code_<catalog>_description`
containing the result of the lookup. In cases where there is no matching code, a `null` is
stored instead. For this example, in `code_icd_10_2016_description`:
```
{
  "code": "Y36521S",
  "code_icd_10_2016_description": "War operations involving indirect blast effect of nuclear weapon, civilian, sequela"
}
```

In cases where the lookup is null or empty for a record, a `null` value is added to the
`column` field.
