# Drop

The DROP directive is used to drop a column in a record.


## Syntax
```
drop <column>[,<column>]*
```

The `<column>` is the name of the column in the record to be droped.


## Usage Notes

After the DROP directive is applied, the column and its associated value are removed from
the record. Later directives will not be able to reference the dropped column.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234434343,
  "measurement": 10.45,
  "isvalid": true
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
drop isvalid,measurement
```

would result in a record with no `isvalid` or `measurement` fields:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "timestamp": 1234434343
}
```
