# Set Record Delim

The SET-RECORD-DELIM directive sets the record delimiter.


## Syntax
```
 set-record-delim <column> <delimiter> [<limit>]
```

## Usage Notes

This directive applies the record delimiter (`<delimiter>`) to generate additional records
using the `<column>`. Optionally, a limit (`<limit>`) can be specified to control the number of records
being generated as the delimiter is applied.
