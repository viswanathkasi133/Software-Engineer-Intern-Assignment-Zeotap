# Cleanse Column Names

The CLEANSE-COLUMN-NAMES directive sanatizes column names, following these rules:

* Trim leading and trailing spaces
* Lowercases the column name
* Replaces any character that are not one of `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]` or `_` with an underscore (`_`)


## Syntax
```
cleanse-column-names
```


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "COL1": 1,
  "col:2": 2,
  "Col3": 3,
  "COLUMN4": 4,
  "col!5": 5
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
cleanse-column-names
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "col1": 1,
  "col_2": 2,
  "col3": 3,
  "column4": 4,
  "col_5": 5
}
```
