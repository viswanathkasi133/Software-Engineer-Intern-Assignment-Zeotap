# Parse AVRO Encoded Messages

The PARSE-AS-AVRO directive parses messages encoded as binary or json AVRO
records or file. This directive requires the registration of schema to be
decoded with [Schema Registry](../service/schema-registry.md)

## Syntax
```
parse-as-avro <column> <schema-id> <json|binary> [<version>]
```

The `<column>` is the name of the column whoes values will be decoded using
the schema defined in [Schema Registry](../service/schema-registry.md)
registered with id `<schema-id>`. Optionally a specific `<version>` of
registered schema can be specified.

## Usage Notes

The PARSE-AS-XML directive efficiently parses and represents an XML document using an
in-memory structure that can then be queried using other directives.
