# Text Metric

The TEXT-METRIC directive provides a metric (from 0 to 1) measuring the difference
between two sequence of characters, using a specified method of measuring the distance
between strings.


## Syntax
```
text-metric <method> <column-1> <column-2> <destination>
```

* `<method>` specifies the method to be used to measure the distance between the strings of
  `<column-1>` and `<column-2>`
* `<destination>` is the column the resulting difference will be stored in. If it exists, it
  will be overwritten. If it does not exist, it will be created.

**Note:** If either or both of the two columns do not exist, no error will be returned,
and the destination column will still be created or overwritten.


## Usage Notes

The value of the metric is always between 0 and 1.

These distance measure methods are supported:

* `block-distance`
* `block`
* `cosine`
* `damerau-levenshtein`
* `dice`
* `euclidean`
* `generalized-jaccard`
* `identity`
* `jaccard`
* `jaro`
* `levenshtein`
* `longest-common-subsequence`
* `longest-common-substring`
* `overlap-cofficient`
* `simon-white`


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "tweet1": "CheeseBurgers are God tellin us everything's gonna be cool...",
  "tweet2": "Beer is God's gift to humankind."
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
text-metric longest-common-subsequence tweet1 tweet2 distance
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "tweet1": "CheeseBurgers are God tellin us everything's gonna be cool...",
  "tweet2": "Beer is God's gift to humankind."
  "destination": 0.26229507
}
```
