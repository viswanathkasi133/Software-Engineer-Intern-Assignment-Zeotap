# Mask Shuffle

The MASK-SHUFFLE directive applies shuffle masking on the column values.


## Syntax
```
mask-shuffle <columm>
```

The `<column>` specifies the name of an existing column to be masked.


## Usage Notes

The MASK-SHUFFLE directive applies shuffle masking on the column values to perform
obfuscation by using random character substitution method. This type of masking is fixed
length masking, where the data is randomly shuffled in the column on the fixed length
string.

Note that vowels, consonants, and numerics are each shuffled separately and retain their
case.

## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie",
  "ssn": "000-00-0000",
  "cc": "4929790943424701"
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
mask-shuffle first
mask-shuffle last
mask-shuffle ssn
mask-shuffle cc
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "first": "Buek",
  "last": "Bumkyy",
  "ssn": "089-75-3119",
  "cc": "0897531194773254"
}
```
