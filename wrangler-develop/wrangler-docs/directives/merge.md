# Merge

The MERGE directive merges two columns by inserting a third column into a record. The
values in the third column are merged values from the two columns delimited by a specified
separator.


## Syntax
```
 merge <first> <second> <new column> '<seperator>'
```

* The `<first>` and `<second>` column values are merged using a separator. The columns to be
  merged must both exist and should be of type string for the merge to be successful.

* The `<new-column>` is the new column that will be added to the record. If the column already exists,
  the contents will be replaced.

* The `<separator>` is the character or string to be used to separate the values in the new
  column. It is specified between single quotes. For example, a space character: `' '`.

* The existing columns are not dropped by this directive.


## Usage Notes

The columns to be merged should both be of type string.


## Examples

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie"
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
merge first last fullname ' '
merge first last fullname '''
merge first last fullname '\u000A'
merge first last fullname '---'
```

would result in these records:

Separator is a single space character (`' '`):
```
{
  "first": "Root",
  "last": "Joltie",
  "fullname": "Root Joltie"
}
```

Separator is a single quote character (`'''`):
```
{
  "fname" : "Joltie",
  "lname" : "Root",
  "name" : "Joltie'Root"
}
```

Separator is the UTF-8 Line Feed character (`'\u000A'`):
```
{
  "fname" : "Joltie",
  "lname" : "Root",
  "name" : "Joltie\nRoot"
}
```

Separator is multiple characters (`'---'`):
```
{
  "fname" : "Joltie",
  "lname" : "Root",
  "name" : "Joltie---Root"
}
```
