# Parse as HL7

The PARSE-AS-HL7 directive is for parsing Health Level 7 Version 2 (HL7 V2) messages.
[HL7](http://www.hl7.org) is a messaging standard used in the healthcare industry to
exchange data between systems.


## Syntax
```
parse-as-hl7 <column>
```

The `<column>` contains HL7 V2 messages, v2.1 through v2.6.


## Usage Notes

This is an example of an [HL7
V2](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185) message in a
record:
```
MSH|^~\&||.|||199908180016||ADT^A04|ADT.1.1698593|P|2.6
PID|1||000395122||LEVERKUHN^ADRIAN^C||19880517180606|M|||6 66TH AVE NE^^WEIMAR^DL^98052||(157)983-3296|||S||12354768|87654321

```

Data in an HL7 V2 message is organized hierarchically as:

* Message = { Segment, Segment, ... Segment }
* Segment = { Field, Field, ... Field }
* Field = { Component, Component, ... Component }
* Component = { Sub-Component, Sub-Component, ... Sub-Component }

Each line of an HL7 V2 message is a segment. A segment is a logical grouping of fields.
The first three characters in a segment identify the segment type. In the above message,
there are five segments: the `MSH` (message header); the `PID` (patient identification);
two `NK1` (next-of-kin) segments; and the `IN1` (insurance).

Each segment consists of fields. A field contains information related to the purpose of
the segment, such as the name of the insurance company in the `IN1` (insurance) segment.
Fields are typically (but not always) delimited by a `|` character.

Fields can be divided into components. Components are typically indicated by a `^`
character. In the above example, the `PID` (patient identification) segment contains a
patient name field containing `LEVERKUHN^ADRIAN^C` which has three parts: last name
(`LEVERKUHN`); first name (`ADRIAN`); and middle initial (`C`). Components can be divided
into subcomponents. Subcomponents are typically indicated by an `&` character.

Parsing the above message using the directive will generate a record that has flattened
HL7 V2 components and all **fields converted to JSON**. Further parsing can be achieved
with the [PARSE-AS-JSON](parse-as-json.md) directive.


## Example

Applying this directive to the above message:
```
parse-as-hl7 body
```

would result in a record of this form:
```
{
  "body": "<original-hl7-message>",
  "body_hl7_MSH_<field-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_MSH_<field-index>_<component-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_PID_<field-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_PID_<field-index>_<component-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_NK1_<field-index>>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_NK1_<field-index>_<component-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_IN1_<field-index>>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
  "body_hl7_IN1_<field-index>_<component-index>": "<primitive-value>",
  ...
}
```

Once each segment has been converted into JSON, you can apply
[PARSE-AS-JSON](parse-as-json.md) or [JSON-PATH](json-path.md) directives on the record.
