# Write as JSON object

The WRITE-AS-JSON-OBJECT directive composes a JSON object based on the fields specified
and writes it to the destination column.


## Syntax
```
write-as-json-object <destination-column> <source-column>[,<source-column>]*
```

The `<destination-column>` will contain a JSON object composed of all the fields
specified in the `<source-column>`.


## Usage Notes

The WRITE-AS-JSON-OBJECT directive composes a JSON Object based on the fields or columns
specified to be added to the object.

Depending on the type of object a field is holding, it will be transformed appropriately
to the JSON types. NULL are also handled and converted to JsonNull.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "number": 1,
  "text": "this, is a string.",
  "height" : 1.5,
  "weight" : 1.67,
  "address" : null
}
```

And applying this directive:
```
write-as-json-object body number,text,height,address
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": { "number":1, "text": "this, is a string.", "height" : 1.5, "address" : null },
  "number": 1,
  "text": "this, is a string.",
  "height" : 1.5,
  "weight" : 1.67,
  "address" : null
}
```
