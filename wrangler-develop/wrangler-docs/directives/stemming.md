# Stemming

The STEMMING directive applies the Porter stemmer algorithm for English words. The
Porter stemmer has excellent trade-off between speed, readability, and accuracy. It stems
using a set of rules (transformations) applied in a succession of steps. Generally, it
applies approximately 60 rules in 6 steps.


## Syntax

```
stemming <column>
```

The `<column>` contains a bag of words of type string array or type string list.


## Usage Notes

The STEMMING directive applies the stemmer on a bag of tokenized words. Applying this
directive creates an additional `<column>_porter` column. Depending on the type of the
object the field is holding, it will be transformed appropriately.


## Example

Using this record, a tokenized bag of words as a string array or list of strings, as an
example:
```
{
  "word" : { "how are you doing ? do you have apples ?" }
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
stemming word
```

The result would be this record:
```
{
  "word": { "how are you doing ? do you have apples ?" },
  "word_porter": { "how", "ar", "you", "do", "do", "you", "have", "appl" }
}
```
