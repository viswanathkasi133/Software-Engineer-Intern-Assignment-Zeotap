# Fill Null or Empty

The FILL-NULL-OR-EMPTY directive fills column value with a fixed value if it is either
`null` or empty ("").


## Syntax

```
fill-null-or-empty <column> <fixed-value>
```

* If the `<column>` does not exist, then the directive will fail.
* The `<fixed-value>` can only be of type string.


## Usage Notes

The FILL-NULL-OR-EMPTY directive fills the column value with the `<fixed-value>` if the
column value is `null` or empty (an empty string, "").

The `<fixed-value>` must be a string and cannot be an empty string value.

When the object in the record is a JSON object and it is `null`, the directive checks that
it is also applied to those records.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "fname": "root",
  "mname": null,
  "lname": "joltie",
  "address": ""
}
```

Applying these directives:
```
fill-null-or-empty mname NA
fill-null-or-empty address No address specified
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "fname": "root",
  "mname": "NA",
  "lname": "joltie",
  "address": "No address specified"
}
```
