# Extract Regex Groups

The EXTRACT-REGEX-GROUPS directive extracts the data from a regex group into its own
column.


## Syntax
```
extract-regex-groups <column> <regex-with-groups>
```

The directive generates additional columns based on the regex in `<regex-with-groups>`.
This ignores the `$0` regex group.


## Usage Notes

If multiple groups are matched, the directive creates multiple columns.

The base name of the column is appended with the match count and match position the
pattern is matched for: `<column>_<match-count>_<match-position>`.


## Example

Using this record as an example:
```
{
  "title": "Toy Story (1995)"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
extract-regex-groups title [^(]+\(([0-9]{4})\).*
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "title": "Toy Story (1995)",
  "title_1_1: "1995"
}
```

The field `title_1_1` follows the format of `<column>_<match-count>_<match-position>`.
