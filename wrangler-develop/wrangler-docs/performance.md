# Performance Evaluation

## Setup

Hardware used for measuring the performance:

* 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5
* 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
* Java 7

## Light Data Transformation DMD

These are the high-level transformations being performed on the data:

* Parsing of CSV
* Drop columns
* Setting defaults on column
* Changing case
* Masking data
* Filtering rows based on an expression

## Directives

```
  parse-as-csv demo , true
  drop demo
  drop demo_12
  fill-null-or-empty demo_11 N/A
  uppercase demo_17
  mask-number demo_18 xxx###
  drop demo_6
  drop demo_7
  fill-null-or-empty demo_5 N/A
  uppercase demo_3
  filter-row-if-true demo_9 =~ "CA"
  mask-number demo_10 xxx##
  mask-shuffle demo_4
```

## Experiments

These two experiments were run: the first with 13M records, and the second with 80M records.

### Experiment #1

* Number of records: 13,499,973
* Number of bytes: 4,499,534,313 (~ 4GB)
* Number of columns: 18

### Performance Numbers

```
count          = 13,376,053
mean rate      = 64998.50 records/second
1-minute rate  = 64921.29 records/second
5-minute rate  = 46866.70 records/second
15-minute rate = 36149.86 records/second
```

### Experiment #2

* Number of records: 80,999,838 (80M)
* Number of bytes: 26,997,205,878 (~ 26GB)
* Number of columns: 18
* Total time: 1294 seconds (21.5 minutes)

### Performance Numbers
```
count          = 80,944,061
mean rate      = 62465.93 records/second
1-minute rate  = 62706.39 records/second
5-minute rate  = 60755.41 records/second
15-minute rate = 56673.32 records/second
```
