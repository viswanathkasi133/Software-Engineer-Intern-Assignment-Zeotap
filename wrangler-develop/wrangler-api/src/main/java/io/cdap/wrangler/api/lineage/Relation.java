/**
 * The <code>Relation</code> class represents a relation between a list of sources to a list of targets.
 * The relation can have 4 different types and can be many-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-many or one-to-one.
 *
 * <p>A relation can be of four different types namely:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     <code>DROP type</code> - This type represents relation with a non-existential destination - one-to-none
 *   type. This type is used when the column wouldn't be present after the transformation is performed.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <code>ALL</code> - This type represents a relation with many, one-to-many or many-to-many relation. This
 *     type is generally used when the transformation is unclear about what columns would be generated.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <code>CREATE</code> - This type represents a relation in which a transformation creates a target without
 *     having any source.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <code>GENERATE</code> - This type represents a relation with many, one-to-many or many-to-many relation. This
 *     type is generaly used when the transformation is unclear about the input columns
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     <code>STANDARD</code> - This type represents all standard relations like many-to-many, many-to-one and
 *     one-to-many.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
