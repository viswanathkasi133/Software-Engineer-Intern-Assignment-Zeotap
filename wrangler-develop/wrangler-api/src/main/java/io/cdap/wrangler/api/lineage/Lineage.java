/**
 * This class <code>Lineage</code> defines a mutation defined by the directive that gets capture as lineage.
 *
 * <p>Directives have to implement this class to inject their mutations for lineage to be constructed.</p>
 * <p>
 *   The method <code>lineage</code> is invoked separately in the <code>prepareRun</code> phase of the pipeline
 *   execution. Before the method <code>lineage</code> is invoked, the framework ensures that the receipe is
 *   parsed and initialize on each directive that is included is called. All the class variables of the directive
 *   are available to be used within the <code>lineage</code> method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   {@link Mutation} captures all the changes the directive is going to be applying of the data. It has
 *   two major methods:
 *
 *   <ul>
 *     <il>
 *       <code>readable</code> - This method is defined to provide the post transformation description of the mutation
 *     the directive is applying on data. Care should be taken to use the right tense as the lineage would be consumed
 *     by users after the transformation has been applied on the data. As best practise, it's highly recommended to use
 *     past-tense for describing the transformations. Additionally, the language of the description is not trying
 *     to provide complete details and configuration, but actually focusing on operations that directive has
 *     performed on data.
 *     </il>
 *     <li>
 *       <code>relation</code> - This methods defines the relations between various columns either being used
 *     as target or source for performing the data transformation. </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * Following are few examples of how the method can be implemented:
 *
 * <code>
 * @Override
 * public Mutation lineage() {
 *   return Mutation.builder()
 *    .readable("Looking up catalog using value in column '%s' and results written into column '%s', src, dest)
 *    .relation(src, Many.of(src, dest))
 *    .build();
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * Another example:
 *
 * <code>
 * @Override
 * public Mutation lineage() {
 *   return Mutation.builder()
 *    .readable("Dropped columns %s", columns")
 *    .drop(Many.of(columns))
 *    .build();
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * @see Mutation
 * @see Relation
 * @see Many
